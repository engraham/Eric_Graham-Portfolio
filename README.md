# 🕵️ Eric Graham | Cybersecurity Portfolio

Welcome! 👋  

I’m **Eric Graham**, an aspiring **Junior Penetration Tester** with a strong focus on offensive security. This portfolio showcases **real-world attack simulations, full exploit chains, and professional-quality reporting**.  

If you want a **fully dedicated and proactive junior security professional** who can execute full pentesting workflows and document them professionally, you’re in the right place!
